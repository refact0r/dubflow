# Electron app rules

## Frontend

**IMPORTANT: This project uses Svelte 5 with runes syntax. Always use runes ($state, $derived, $effect, etc.) instead of the legacy reactive statements (like `let count = 0` with `$:` statements) and stores.**

When making any edits to any frontend files, refer to the /docs/svelte-documentation-medium.txt file for:

- Svelte 5 syntax and best practices
- SvelteKit conventions and patterns
- Component structure and lifecycle
- State management approaches
- Routing and navigation

You can also take advantage of the Svelte MCP Server if you need more help.
